Reflection:
I think with this project I solidified my knowledge of basic CSS. In the beginning I had especially problems with understanding the box-model, flexbox and how containers and inheritance work. By now, I'm a bit more comfortable with these concepts.
I also experienced with this project how important it is to structure (and indent!) your html well. A few times because of this I was stuck simply because I targeted the wrong container with my CSS. I also got a glimpse of how important it is to properly name your elements and to think about what exactly you should target with CSS (elements, classes, id's?). Especially with a bigger, more intricate webpage things can get confusing very fast.
By now, the page should look quite fine, though it is not responsive to different solutions. Maybe I come back another time and try to make it responsive, but for now, that's it.
