# Google Homepage Clone

This was my first project from the Foundations curriculum at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Reflection

- I think with this project I solidified my knowledge of basic CSS. In the beginning I had especially problems with understanding the box-model, flexbox and how containers and inheritance work. By now, I'm a bit more comfortable with these concepts.
- I also experienced with this project how important it is to structure (and indent!) your html well. A few times because of this I was stuck simply because I targeted the wrong container with my CSS.
- I also got a glimpse of how important it is to properly name your elements and to think about what exactly you should target with CSS (elements, classes, id's?). Especially with a bigger, more intricate webpage things can get confusing very fast.
